Flexbox is a set of CSS properties that give you a flexible way to lay out content. With flexbox you can change the direction, alignment, size and order of elements, regardless of their original size and order in the HTML. You can even stretch and shrink elements and distribute space, all with just a few lines of CSS!

What I learned from this course::

1. Understanding Flexbox: Understood the terminology and concepts behind flexbox.
2. Flexbox Properties: Learned advanced flexbox properties for layout direction, order, alignment, sizing and more
3. Building a Layout with Flexbox: Used newly learned flexbox skills and build the layout for a simple web page.
